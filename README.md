# .NET Core Telegram Bot Development Kit
This package offers a very simple and straightforward implementation of parts of the Telegram Bot API.

## History
This package exists for one bad and one good reason, the bad reason being that the existing more comprehensive implementations of the Telegram Bot API for .NET simply did not work for me. 
The libraries had grown too big and implemented all kinds of intelligent processing that caused my bots to become unreliable and unstable.
I created this API implementation as a very simple alternative, to act as a basis for all my bots.

The good reason is that I needed a library to power all my bots, and think there is no need to copy the code all the time...
